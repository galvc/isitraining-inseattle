## Tools and libraries
Using axios, styled-components, Open Weather Map API, Unsplash API, ReactLazyLoad
Using gitpod.io as a virtual workspace
Deployed the website to netlify

## Improvements
### 10/30/19
Randomized the photos that will show on the first load
Refactored code
Fetches photo that is less resource-heavy
Used ReactLazyLoad to lazy load the background image
Added error-catching when checking the weather. Select 'Tri-cities' in the dropdown box to see the error message.
Reduced background opacity to make the text easier to read
Fixed some broken links

### Notes
- Since I am using a virtual worksapce, I couldn't find the .env files that stores my api keys. I understand it needs to be hidden in a normal build
