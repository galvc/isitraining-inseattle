## Is it raining in Seattle?
It's always raining in Seattle.

But now, you can know for sure! You're welcome.

## Technical Environment
Created with create-react-app. Used Open Weather Map API, Unsplash API, and styled-components.

## Learnings
Had a lot of fun learning promises with axios and styles with styled-components. 
At first, I had decided to use libraries like Grommet, Bootstrap, or Rebass, but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I discovered styled-components were easier than I thought! Less back on forth on the docs and offers more flexibility with styling.

## Future Improvements
I will be tweaking the styling a little bit more, like overlaying a tint on the background image.
I am also planning on deploying this.
